        <h1>3D Benchy and the Bed of Acrylic</h1>
        <article>
            <p>Posted on January 16, 2025</p>
            <p>Welcome True Believers and Newcomers alike, had something mildly interesting to share today.</p>
            <p>As part of IIT Bombay's Rapid Manufacturing Laboratory, I was tasked with fixing and testing an Ender 3 Pro printer. </p>
            <p>The Ender 3 Pro  is a widely popular, budget-friendly 3D printer that uses fused deposition modeling (FDM) technology to create objects by layering materials like PLA and ABS. 
                Known for its reliability and ease of use, it features a removable magnetic bed for easy print removal, smooth V-slot wheels for quieter operation, and a build volume of 220 x 220 x 250 mm, making it ideal for small to medium-sized projects. 
                Its modular design allows for easy assembly and customization, making it a favorite among beginners and experienced tinkerers.</p>
            <p>The 3D printer suffered two problems. 
                Firstly, the printer gave a temperature error, upon which we first replaced the thermistor to no avail. 
                We then replaced the Creality v.4.2.2. motherboard which sucessfully fixed the printer and began functioning as it usually would.</p>
            <p>The second issue was that printing bed was damaged extensively due to heavy use which meant we were in need of a new bed. 
                However, the a new bed would cost upwards of Rs.2500. 
                So we went with an alternative solution.</p>
            <p>Lo and behold, "the Bed of Acrylic" aka a simple Acrylic sheet cut to size for the printer's dimensions from a local retailer's scrap for the small price of Rs.85 and guess what is worked to perfection. </p>
            <p>For the test print, we printed the good ol' 3DBenchy.
                3DBenchy is a small, detailed 3D model designed specifically to test and calibrate the performance of 3D printers. 
                Often called "The jolly 3D printing torture-test," it helps evaluate features like overhangs, bridging, and surface finish in additive manufacturing processes.</p>
                <p> While the print was scaled down a bit due to lack of materials, The print came off extermely well from the bed surface. 
                    Another thing to point out was the acrylic's smooth and shiny surface rubbed off well on the first layer, making the rest of the 3D model well too. 
                    Still there's more testing & research to be done on acrylic as a 3D printing bed surface, Hopefully I can do more testing once more material arrives till then Adios!! </p>
